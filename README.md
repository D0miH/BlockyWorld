# BlockyWorld
A simple Minecraft clone made with Unity to experiment with infinite procedural terrain generation.

## Features
- Multiple layers of different terrain (grass, stone and dirt)
- Performance optimization: Only the outer (visible) faces of each chunk are rendered
- Blocks can be removed by clicking on them (edited chunks are updated to re-render the visible faces)
